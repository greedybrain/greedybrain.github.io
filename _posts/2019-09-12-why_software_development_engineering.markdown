So, it all started a few years ago. It must've been on my 22nd or 23rd birthday where I thought to myself that I'm not getting any younger. It's as if an arrow of light that only I can see directed me to a Barnes and Nobles book store.  I remember, it was the one residing on Union Turnpike, Queens NY. I walked in, feeling as if I were being directed by an entity outside of myself. I approached a representative there, it was a woman, and I remember asking her if she knew where the books were on Computer Programming. She pointed toward the steps headed downstairs and told me it was down there. I pretty much figured out the rest from there, as there were signs and indication labels to further assist me. When I found the related books, I took interest to a book about a programming language we all (some may disagree) know and love titled [C++ Programming](https://amzn.to/2Q5HSYN).

It was a For Dummies book to be specific. I ended up purchasing it and the irony here is, here I thought that that book was the entirety of Computer Programming (Dummie). It was until I got home and went on my computer to do more research about Computer programming and I found out that it was only a language **TO** program, and not **PROGRAMMING** itself. It made me more curious so I started navigating through the well known online retail giant, Amazon's website. I found another For Dummies book titled [Beginning Programming](https://amzn.to/3006xlc).

It was a bit massive with a whole lot of essential information. It was this book that got me so into computer programming. It was this book that started to open doors for me that allowed me to seek out other resources and materials to better understand it. I never looked back every since. Along the journey, you may hit a lot of obstacles which in turn will lead you to procrastinating and feeling the need to give up. I learned that this is normal so I  just do my best to ride through any storm that presents itself to me.
