**How I interpret Object Oriented Programming?**

In a nutshell, OOP to me is just simply, structure. To elaborate further, all of the principles of OOP that I've learned thus far, I can say so far, that it's grooming me into being a more organized programmer. I remember the good ole days where I would  write all of my code in one file thinking that I was the man once I ran it and it worked "ha, yea right". I mean, the program will work but then when it came to debugging and whatnot, it became a tad bit tedious to go through. I mean look at this mess ...

If you took a look at the images above you'll see that  I was all over the place, but not "all over the place" if you know what I mean. At this time I never knew anything about Separation of concerns, one source of truthiness and what have you. Basically, in the above program I was using Python to scrape the website Indeed.com based on a users input of their preferred search radius, job title, and city or zip code. Here, I applied no OOP principles whatsoever, and to see my self grow so much in just 2 and a half to 3 months is extremely gratifying. I'm starting to understand OOP principles and techniques more and more as I progress with Flatiron. I'm even able to reinforce what I'm learning by helping other cohortmates. 

Furthermore, in addition to OOP allowing your program to be less error prone, it also helps you to see your program from more of a narrative or movie like persepctive. Meaning, that each part of your program starts to tell a story. I start thinking of each of my classes as movie scenes. How does this scene relate to that scene, and that scene to this one? And so on and so forth. Ultimately, I believe that OOP, and ones approach to it should be all about perspective; how does each part move around and associates itslef with other parts.
