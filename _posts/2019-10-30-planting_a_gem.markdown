The Gem that i've developed is called website_worth. Simple enough, huh? Well, the process of developing this gem was a tad bit tedious if not complicated. By using quite a few of the OOP(Object Oriented Programming) practices that i've learned throughout this course so far I managed to create this Gem in a professional, structured, elite programmer way. At least, I'd like to think that. I used classes and modules for for keeping things neat and for the structure. I used class methods and the "attr's" to maintain healthy relationships between my files. Then in my CLI file is where it all came together. 

In a nutshell, this gem allows a user to get the estimated revenue and traffic data on any website that they're interested in. To be a bit more specific, it pulls the overall worth, recurring revenue, and traffic on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. It also provides the user with that sites Alexa ranking. All of this couldn't be done without the help of this magnificent library "Gem" known as Nokogiri. With Nokogiri, the process of scraping all of the data from an already exisiting website calculator site was much easier, rather than having to manually copy and paste all of that data which would be completely inefficient, "thank you Nokogiri". Besides, we are programmers, who copy's and paste.

Nokogiri allowed me to input a url of a website and then pinpoint the html information that I needed to scrape within. This requires some knowledge in the use of Googles Chrome tools, specifically the inspect element. I used this tool to actually tell Nokogiri what I wanted. It's a very essential tool that chrome has and one that I would recommend all programmers to use for whatever project they are working on that involves scraping. 

Here's a link to the github repo if you're interested in trying it out yourself!
